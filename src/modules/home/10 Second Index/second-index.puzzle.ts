/**
 * # Second Index
 * 
 * - Difficulty: Elementary+
 * 
 * ## Description
 * You are given two `string`s and you have to find an index of the 
 * second occurrence of the second `string` in the first one.
 * 
 * Let's go through the first example where you need to find the second 
 * occurrence of `s` in a word `sims`.
 * Itâ€™s easy to find its first occurrence with a function `indexOf` 
 * which will point out that `s` is the first symbol in a word `sims` 
 * and therefore the index of the first occurrence is `0`. But we have 
 * to find the second `s` which is `4`th in a row and that means that 
 * the index of the second occurrence (and the answer to a question) is 
 * `3`.
 * 
 * ## Input
 * Two `string`s.
 * 
 * ## Output
 * `Int` or `undefined`
 * 
 * ## Example
 * ```ts
 * secondIndex('sims', 's') == 3;
 * secondIndex('find the river', 'e') == 12;
 * secondIndex('hi', ' ')  == undefined;
 * ```
 *
 * @param {string} text
 * @param {string} symbol
 * @return {*}  {(number | undefined)}

function secondIndex(text: string, symbol: string): number | undefined {
  const first = text.indexOf(symbol);
  const second = text.indexOf(symbol, first + 1);
  return (!!(first + 1))
    ? (!!(second + 1))
      ? second
      : undefined
    : undefined;
}

export { secondIndex as my };
