 * # Popular Words
 * 
 * - Difficulty: Elementary+
 * 
 * ## Description
 * In this mission your task is to determine the popularity of certain 
 * words in the text.
 * 
 * At the `input` of your function are given `2` arguments - the `text` 
 * and the `array` of words the popularity of which you need to 
 * determine.
 * 
 * ### When solving this task pay attention to the following points:
 * - The words should be sought in all registers. This means that if you
 *  need to find a word `one` then words like `one`, `One`, `oNe`, `ONE`
 *  etc. will do.
 * - The search words are always indicated in the lowercase.
 * - If the word wasnâ€™t found even once, it has to be returned in the
 * dictionary with `0` value.
 * 
 * ## Input
 * - The `text`
 * - The search words array.
 * 
 * ## Output
 * The dictionary where the search words are the keys and values are the
 * number of times when those words are occurring in a given text.
 * 
 * ## Example
 * ```ts
 * popularWords('When I was One \n\
 * I had just begun\n\
 * When I was Two\n\
 * I was nearly new', ['i', 'was', 'three', 'near']) == {
 *     'i': 4,
 *     'was': 3,
 *     'three': 0,
 *     'near': 0
 * };
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Precondition
 * The `input` text will consists of English letters in uppercase and 
 * lowercase and whitespaces.
 *
 * @param {string} text
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {*}
